# Spencer_Chun_FP-A_Repository
Dear Netflix Hiring Manager,

This is a project that I worked on recently analyzing FDIC data on commercial banking and corporate banking ofcies in teh United States from 1934-2017. I strongly believe that this project shows my abilities of data analytics and experience in developing data visualizations using complex programming. I hope that this repository can prove helpful to the Netflix Hiring committee.
